# Composer Dependency Fix - lcobucci/clock

## Problem

The CI build was failing with the following error when running:
```bash
composer update --no-interaction --no-progress --prefer-dist -W qossmic/deptrac-shim rector/rector
```

### Error Message
```
Problem 1
  - Root composer.json requires lcobucci/clock ^3.0,<3.4, found lcobucci/clock[3.0.0, ..., 3.3.1] 
    but the package is fixed to 3.4.0 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version 
    does not match.

Problem 2
  - lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle is locked to version v3.1.1
  - lcobucci/clock 3.4.0 requires php ~8.3.0 || ~8.4.0 -> your php version (8.2.29) does not 
    satisfy that requirement.
  - lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle v3.1.1 requires lcobucci/clock ^3.0
```

## Root Cause

The `composer.lock` file had `lcobucci/clock` locked to version **3.4.0**, which requires PHP 8.3+. However:
- The project uses **PHP 8.2.29** (as configured in `composer.json` platform settings)
- The `composer.json` correctly specifies `"lcobucci/clock": "^3.0,<3.4"` to exclude version 3.4.x
- The lock file was out of sync with these constraints

## Solution

Ran the following command to update the lock file for `lcobucci/clock`:
```bash
cd backend && composer update lcobucci/clock --no-interaction --no-progress --prefer-dist
```

This resolved `lcobucci/clock` to version **3.3.1**, which:
- ✅ Satisfies the constraint `^3.0,<3.4` in composer.json
- ✅ Is compatible with PHP 8.2 (requires `~8.2.0 || ~8.3.0 || ~8.4.0`)
- ✅ Satisfies the dependency requirements of `lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle`

## Verification

After the fix:
```bash
$ composer show lcobucci/clock
name     : lcobucci/clock
versions : * 3.3.1
requires:
  php ~8.2.0 || ~8.3.0 || ~8.4.0
  psr/clock ^1.0
```

The `composer.lock` file now correctly locks `lcobucci/clock` at version 3.3.1 (line 1575).

## Status

✅ **RESOLVED** - The composer dependency conflict has been fixed. The original CI command should now work correctly.
